**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
I was having trouble understanding exactly how git tracks changes. Reading through the git docs resource hammered it in for me.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
git fetch and git merge

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
How do you choose your feature branch names?
In what situations have you experienced merge conflicts and how do you fix it?


**What still confuses you about git?**
I'm still terrified of merge errors, I wouldn't know what to do if my github merge showed a mismatch to the origin.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
It was unfortunate that I didn't have a pair, but my guide was helpful and I still learned a lot.
